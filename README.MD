# DOM - Matching Game

This mini project was created to further consolidate my understanding of DOM manipulation, using only HTML, Javascript and simple styling with CSS.

During the software development bootcamp, one of the sprints were to create a mini game with DOM and the progress did not get very far, therefore this Animal Crossing Game was created to make up for the lack of outcome as a small personal project.

## Tutorial 

The game was created using Kenny Yip's tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz9jeI9M9hI&t=90s&ab_channel=KennyYipCoding) as a guide. 

## Running thie game locally: 

Ensure that Live Server extension is installed on the VS Code. 

To run this game on a local environment, simply ```git clone``` in the terminal and hit ```Go Live```. Follow along to 'localhost: **port number**'. 

Replace **port number** with the actual number Live Server provides
